For being able to develop, you need to create a file called appkey.h in the root folder of the
spokify project with the Application Key that Spotify provided you.

Usually, Application Keys are only provided to Premium Users, so you will need to be a premium user to
develop Spokify.

This Application Key provided by Spotify can be found at:

https://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/application-key/

once you have logged in at the web as a Premium User.

Click on "c-code", and download it as "appkey.h". Place it where has been told before, on the root
directory of the Spokify project.

Its appearance is something like this:

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
const uint8_t g_appkey[] = {
    0xHERE, 0xCAN, 0xBE, 0xFOUND,
    0xLOTS, 0xOF, 0xHEXADECIMAL, 0xNUMBERS
};
const size_t g_appkey_size = sizeof(g_appkey);
