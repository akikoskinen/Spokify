For being able to develop, you need to create a file called api_key.h in the root folder of the
spokify project with the API Key that Spotify provided you.

Usually, API Keys are only provided to Premium Users, so you will need to be a premium user to
develop Spokify.

This API Key provided by Spotify can be found at:

https://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/application-key/

once you have logged in at the web as a Premium User.

Click on "c-code", and download it as "api_key.h". Place it where has been told before, on the root
directory of the Spokify project.
